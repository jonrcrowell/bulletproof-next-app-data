We didn't eat turkey as the main course this year. We bought turkey drumsticks and simmered them in water to make them super tender. They were actually edible.

Of course, the mashed potatoes stole the show, as they do every year.

We skipped the cranberry sauce this time.

We got a pumpkin pie from La Casita Bakery that was good but not noticeably better than the pies we get at Central Market.
